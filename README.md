# Bonus-Points
This program is a webapp designed to allow the issuance of 
bonus points in a simple, mobile compatible fasion.
The teacher.html page fetchs its data from the server in 
.json format, while the student.html page simply has it's
table hardcoded in. The page communicates with the server.js
file currently, although the server does not store any changes
in a database...yet.
